Name: Amruta Bhale

Company: CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS

Id: CT6WTDS358

Domain: DATA SCIENCE

Duration: July to September 2024

Mentor: Muzammil Ahmed

Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


Overview of the project:

Objectives: 

1.Perform EDA on a dataset to understand its characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers.

2.Visualize the findings using various plots to gain insights into the data.


Key Activities:

1.Data loading: Load the dataset using pandas.

2.Data Cleaning:  Check and handle missing values, duplicates, and any inconsistence in the data.

3.Data Exploration:
•	Summary Statistics: Compute summary statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
•	Distribution Analysis: Plot histogram and box plots to understand the distribution of variables.
•	Correlation Analysis: Compute and Visualize correlations between variables using heatmaps.
•	Outlier Detection: Identify and visualize outliers using box plots and scatter plot.

Technology Used: 
Python: The programming language used for Analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and Analysis.
Numpy: For numerical Operations.
Matplotlib: For creating graph & visualizations.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization based on matplotlib.

Key Insights:
1.Distributions of variables: Histogram and box plot revealed the distribution of the data, heighlighting skewness and the presence of outliers.
2. Correlation between variables: Heatmap shows significant correlations between certain pairs of variables.
3. Outliers: Box plots identified the outliers, which could be important for further analysis or modelling.
